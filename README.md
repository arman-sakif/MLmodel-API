## üöÄ Setup and Deployment

The most straightforward way to get this project up and running is by executing the provided Google Colab notebook.

### 1. Open and Run the Google Colab Notebook

1.  Click on the following link to open the notebook in Google Colab:
    [**Open in Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME/blob/main/iris_classifier_colab.ipynb)
    *(Remember to replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub details)*
2.  Once opened, execute all cells sequentially by going to `Runtime > Run all`.
3.  The notebook will guide you through:
    * Installing necessary Python packages.
    * Training the Iris classification model and saving it to a local `./model` directory within the Colab environment.
    * Generating `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, and `requirements.txt` files based on the project's needs.
    * **(Optional)** Providing instructions and code to test the FastAPI locally using `ngrok` (for temporary public access during development).
    * Prompting you to enter your Hugging Face write token.
    * Programmatically creating a new Hugging Face Space (configured with the Docker SDK) under your namespace.
    * Uploading all essential project files (`app.py`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `model/` directory) to your newly created Hugging Face Space.

### 2. Configure Hugging Face Space Secrets

This is a **CRITICAL** step to ensure the security of your API's authentication credentials:

1.  After the Colab notebook successfully uploads your files, navigate to your Hugging Face Space page in your web browser. The URL will look like:
    `https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_USERNAME/iris-classifier-api-colab`
2.  Click on the **"Settings"** tab for your Space.
3.  Scroll down to the **"Secrets"** section.
4.  Add two new secrets:
    * **Name:** `API_USERNAME`
        **Value:** Choose a strong, unique username that only your team will know.
    * **Name:** `API_PASSWORD`
        **Value:** Choose a strong, unique password for your API.
5.  These secrets are securely stored by Hugging Face and will be automatically injected as environment variables into your running Docker container. Your FastAPI application will then retrieve these values to validate incoming requests.

### 3. Monitor Deployment

* Once you've pushed the files and configured the secrets, Hugging Face Spaces will automatically detect the changes and begin building your Docker image and deploying your application.
* You can monitor the build process and runtime logs by clicking on the **"Logs"** tab on your Space page.
* When the status changes to "Running", your API is fully live and ready to receive requests!

## üß™ How to Test the API

You can test the deployed API using the provided `test_iris_api.py` Python script or by directly using `curl` from your terminal.

### Using `test_iris_api.py`

1.  **Download:** Save the `test_iris_api.py` file to your local machine.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the `requests` library installed:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
3.  **Update Configuration:** Open `test_iris_api.py` in a text editor and update the following variables with your specific details:
    * `API_BASE_URL`: This is the public URL of your Hugging Face Space application. It will be in the format `https://YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_USERNAME-iris-classifier-api-colab.hf.space`. You can find this URL prominently displayed on your Hugging Face Space page.
    * `API_USERNAME`: Enter the exact username you set as a secret on Hugging Face Spaces.
    * `API_PASSWORD`: Enter the exact password you set as a secret on Hugging Face Spaces.
4.  **Run the script:** Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python test_iris_api.py
    ```
    You should see the prediction results in a clear JSON format.

### Using `curl`

You can also test the API directly from your terminal using `curl`.

1.  **Encode Credentials:** First, encode your API username and password in Base64:
    ```bash
    echo -n "YOUR_API_USERNAME:YOUR_API_PASSWORD" | base64
    # Example output: dGVzdHVzZXI6dGVzdHBhc3M= (This is for "testuser:testpass")
    ```
    Copy the resulting base64 encoded string.

2.  **Send POST Request:** Replace `YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_USERNAME-iris-classifier-api-colab.hf.space` with your actual Space's URL and `YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS` with the string you generated in the previous step.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_USERNAME-iris-classifier-api-colab.hf.space/predict" \
         -H "accept: application/json" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS" \
         -d '{"sepal_length": 5.0, "sepal_width": 3.4, "petal_length": 1.5, "petal_width": 0.3}'
    ```

## üåê API Endpoints

The deployed FastAPI application exposes the following endpoints:

* **`POST /predict`**
    * **Description:** Predicts the species of an Iris flower based on provided features.
    * **Authentication:** Requires HTTP Basic Authentication.
    * **Request Body (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "sepal_length": 5.1,
          "sepal_width": 3.5,
          "petal_length": 1.4,
          "petal_width": 0.2
        }
        ```
    * **Response Body (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "predicted_species": "setosa",
          "prediction_probabilities": {
            "setosa": 0.9999999999999999,
            "versicolor": 1.1102230246251565e-16,
            "virginica": 0.0
          }
        }
        ```

* **`GET /health`**
    * **Description:** A simple health check endpoint to verify the API is running and the model is loaded.
    * **Authentication:** None required.
    * **Response Body (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "status": "ok",
          "model_loaded": true
        }
        ```

You can also access the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) directly in your browser at:
`https://YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_USERNAME-iris-classifier-api-colab.hf.space/docs`

## üîí Authentication

This API utilizes **HTTP Basic Authentication** for access control. This means that every request to the `/predict` endpoint must include an `Authorization` header containing your base64-encoded `username:password` string. The actual credentials (`API_USERNAME` and `API_PASSWORD`) are securely stored as environment variables (secrets) within your Hugging Face Space.

## üí° Future Improvements

* **Enhanced Error Handling:** Implement more granular error handling for various scenarios (e.g., invalid input types, model loading failures).
* **Structured Logging:** Integrate a robust logging framework to capture application events and errors more effectively.
* **Monitoring & Alerting:** Set up external monitoring for API uptime, performance, and error rates.
* **Advanced Authentication:** For production-grade applications, explore more sophisticated authentication mechanisms like OAuth2, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or dedicated API Key management systems.
* **Scalability & Load Balancing:** For higher traffic volumes, investigate advanced deployment options such as Google Cloud Run with custom domains, Kubernetes, or other serverless solutions.
* **Model Versioning:** Implement a systematic approach for managing and deploying different versions of your machine learning model.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate the testing, building, and deployment process using Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment tools.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

* **`404 Not Found` when testing the API:**
    * **Cause:** This almost always means the `API_BASE_URL` in your `test_iris_api.py` script is incorrect.
    * **Solution:** Ensure `API_BASE_URL` is set to the correct Hugging Face Space subdomain URL (e.g., `https://YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_USERNAME-iris-classifier-api-colab.hf.space`), **not** the `huggingface.co/spaces/...` URL.

* **`401 Unauthorized` when testing the API:**
    * **Cause:** Incorrect `API_USERNAME` or `API_PASSWORD` in your `test_iris_api.py` script, or the secrets were not correctly set on Hugging Face Spaces.
    * **Solution:** Double-check your credentials in `test_iris_api.py` against the secrets you configured in your Hugging Face Space settings. Ensure your Hugging Face API token used for pushing has "write" permissions.

* **"You don't have the rights to create a space..." error during Colab push:**
    * **Cause:** The Hugging Face API token used in Colab does not have "write" permissions, or the `your_hf_username` variable in your Colab notebook does not exactly match your Hugging Face profile username.
    * **Solution:** Generate a new Hugging Face token with "write" permissions at <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens> and update it in your Colab notebook. Verify your `your_hf_username` variable is correct (case-sensitive).
